General</h4><p>These general license terms and conditions shall apply to any purchase and use of Habbo NFT’s (the “Terms”). These NFT Terms are a legal agreement between you as a buyer and rightful ‘owner’ of the Habbo NFT(‘s) (the “(Purchased) Habbo NFT”) and licensee   of   the   Art   (as   hereinafter   defined),   regardless   whether   you   are   the   one minting the NFT or if you are any subsequent holder (the “NFT Holder” or “you”), and Sulake   Oy   (the   “Company”,   “we”   or   “us”),   the   seller   of   the   Habbo   NFT   and   the licensor   of   the   Art.   “Art”   means   the   combined   visual   and/or   audio   elements   as explicitly associated by us with a Habbo NFT.</p><h4>2. NFT Purchase</h4><dl><dt>2.1.</dt><dd>By purchasing a Habbo NFT you acquire those rights associated with the Habbo NFT. When offered by us, we reserve the right to modify the types, prices, and numbers of Habbo NFT’s available at our discretion.</dd><dt>2.2.</dt><dd>Any payments or financial transactions related to Habbo NFT’s that you engage in via the marketplace we select or elsewhere, will be conducted solely through the   Ethereum   network.   We   have   no   control   over   these   payments   or transactions,   nor   do   we   have   the   ability   to   reverse   any   payments   or transactions. We have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any payments or transactions that you engage   in   via   the   Ethereum   network.   We   do   not   provide   refunds   for   any purchases that you might make on the Ethereum network.</dd><dt>2.3.</dt><dd>By buying a Habbo NFT, you agree to pay to us all applicable fees, costs and royalties and authorize us to automatically deduct these amounts directly from your payment. Each payment of transaction fees is final and cannot be subject to   any   refund,   without   regard   to   any   event   that   may   negatively   affect   the underlying transaction.</dd><dt>2.4.</dt><dd>It is your sole responsibility to pay any taxes deriving from the sale of Habbo NFT’s. If the Company is required to pay any taxes on your behalf, you will remit payment to the Company within thirty days (30) of notification by the Company.</dd><dt>2.5.</dt><dd>Ethereum  requires   the  payment   of  a   transaction   fee   (called   a   “Gas   Fee”)  for every   transaction   that   occurs   on   the   Ethereum   network.   You   will   be   solely responsible to pay the Gas Fee. You agree to hold the Company harmless for any losses you may incur as a consequence of minting or buying your Habbo NFT.   These  potential  losses   include  any   Gas   Fees   for   failed  transactions,   any excessive Gas  Fees  charged due to  website or smart  contract  bugs,  and any loss of your Habbo NFT due to website or smart contract bugs.</dd><dt>2.6.</dt><dd>You acknowledge that the terms of the smart contract used on the Ethereum network   govern   the   purchase   of   any   Habbo   NFT,   including   royalty   that   is payable to us. In addition, the marketplace used for the purchase will impose its own terms and conditions that further govern your purchase of a Habbo NFT.</dd></dl><h4>3. HABBO NFT’S PRICES &amp; ASSUMPTION OF RISKS</h4><dl><dt>3.1</dt><dd>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRICES OF BLOCKCHAIN DIGITAL ASSETS MAY BE EXTREMELY   VOLATILE.   FLUCTUATIONS   IN   THE   PRICE   OR   VALUE   OF   OTHER DIGITAL  ASSETS COULD MATERIALLY  AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF YOUR HABBO NFT’S. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE –AND THEREFORE WE CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE– THAT ANY HABBO NFT WILL NOT LOSE OR WILL GAIN VALUE 1 (OR   HAVE   ANY   ECONOMIC   VALUE   WHATSOEVER)   OR   HAVE   ANY   KIND   OF FUNCTIONALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</dd><dt>3.2</dt><dd>YOU   ALSO   UNDERSTAND   THERE   ARE   RISKS   ASSOCIATED   WITH   NFT TRANSACTIONS   INCLUDING,   BUT   NOT   LIMITED   TO,   THE   EFFECTS   OF   VARYING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE RISK OF HARDWARE, OPERATING SYSTEM AND INTERNET   CONNECTIONS,   THE   RISK   OF   VIRUS   INTRODUCTION,   AND   THE   RISK THAT THIRD PARTIES MAY OBTAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.   BY   PURCHASING   AND   SELLING   HABBO   NFT’S   YOU   ARE ACCEPTING SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY AND ALL TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING HABBO NFT DIGITAL COLLECTIBLES.</dd></dl><h4>4. Ownership and IP Rights</h4><dl><dt>4.1.</dt><dd><u>Ownership   of   Habbo   NFT</u>.   Each   Habbo   NFT   is   associated   with   an   NFT   on   the Ethereum network. When you acquire a Habbo NFT, you own the NFT, not the associated Art or any Third Party  IP (as hereinafter defined). This means that you have the right to trade or swap your Habbo NFT, sell it, or give it away. Except in cases where we determine that the Habbo NFT has not been rightfully acquired and/or not from a legitimate source, at no point will we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Habbo NFT. “Third Party IP” means any third-party patent rights, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other intellectual property rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the world.</dd><dt>4.2.</dt><dd><u>Further Ownership Acknowledgements and Limitations</u>. For the sake of clarity, you   understand   and   agree:   (1)   that   you   do   not   have   the   right,   except   as otherwise   set   forth   in   these   Terms,   to   reproduce,   distribute,   or   otherwise commercialize   any   elements   of   the   Art,   Habbo   name   or   any   other   Habbo materials without our prior written consent in each case; and (2) that you may not,   nor   permit   any   third   party   to   do   or   attempt   to   do   any   of   the   following without Company&#x27;s express prior written consent in each case: (i) use the Art in connection   with   images,   videos,   or   other   forms   of   media   that   depict   hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others or infringe any applicable law or (ii) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional   intellectual   property   rights   in   or   to   the   Art;   to   the   extent   that   Art contains   Third   Party   IP   (e.g.,   licensed   intellectual   property   from   a   celebrity, athlete, or other public figure), you understand and agree as follows: (iii) that you   will   not   have   the   right   to   use   such   Third   Party   IP   in   any   way   except   as incorporated   in   the   Art,   and   subject   to   the   license   and   restrictions   contained herein.</dd><dt>4.3.</dt><dd><u>Personal Use</u>. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased   Habbo   NFT(’s),   solely   for   the   following   purposes:   (1)   for   your   own personal,   non-commercial   use;   (2)   as   part   of   a   marketplace   that   permits   the purchase   and   sale   of   your   Purchased   Habbo   NFT(’s),   provided   that   the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Habbo NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased Habbo NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (3) as part of a third party website or application that permits the   inclusion,   involvement,   or   participation   of   your   Purchased   Habbo   NFT, provided   that   the   website/application   cryptographically   verifies   each   Habbo NFT’s owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased Habbo NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer   visible   once   the   owner   of   the   Purchased   Habbo   NFT   leaves   the website/application.</dd><dt>4.4.</dt><dd><u>Commercial Use</u>.     Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, copy,   and   display   the   Art   for   your   Purchased   Habbo   NFT   for   the   purpose   of commercializing your  own merchandise that includes, contains,  or  consists  of the Art for your Habbo NFT (“Commercial Use”), provided that such Commercial Use does not (a) suggest a commercial link with any of our brands (including Habbo); (b) suggest a commercial link with a third party without prior written consent, (c) use other of our IP without our prior written consent, (d) complies with our guidelines which can be found <a href="../guidelines/index.html">here</a> and may be amended by us from time to time or (e) result in you earning more than USD 100,000 in gross revenue each year. In the event your Commercial Use exceeds USD 100,000 in a given year, you will need to enter into a commercial license with us and must contact us for this purpose (which will   be   in   our   sole   and   absolute   discretion).   If   you   exceed   the   USD   100,000 limitation,   you   will   be   in   breach   of   these   Terms.   Without   entering   into   a commercial license with us, you acknowledge and agree that: in case  you are in breach of these Terms; in addition to any remedies that may be available to us at law or in equity, we may immediately terminate the license granted above; and   you   will   be   liable   and   responsible   to   reimburse   us   for   any   costs   and expenses incurred by us during the course of enforcing these Terms against you (including   attorney   and   legal   fees).   For   the   avoidance   of   doubt,   you acknowledge that we can refuse to consent to granting the license at our sole discretion. Circumstances that will in any event require us to refuse granting the license are (i) use of other Habbo related art; (ii) a combination with other art from   third   parties;   and/or   (iii)   use   that   suggests   a   commercial   connection between us and you.</dd><dt>4.5.</dt><dd>For the avoidance of doubt, the personal and commercial licenses under these terms   are   strictly   limited   to   the  combined  visual  and/or   audio   elements.   It   is strictly prohibited and a  violation  of these Terms  to use any elements of the combined Art separately or to create a similar or derivative materials. Such use constitutes   a   violation   of   these   Terms   as   well   as   intellectual   property infringement, which would cause monetary  damages  and irreparable harm to us. The restriction in this Section 4 will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.</dd></dl><h4>5. DISCLAIMERS. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4><dl><dt>5.1.</dt><dd>THE HABBO NFT IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES,   GUARANTEES,   DUTIES,   OR   CONDITIONS,   STATUTORY   OR OTHERWISE, OF ANY KIND.</dd><dt>5.2.</dt><dd>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPLICIT OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE.</dd><dt>5.3.</dt><dd>NFT’S ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS.
